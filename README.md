# Color Generator Project

## Overview

This project is a simple color generator built using JavaScript's `Math.random()` function to create random colors. Every time you use the generator, it produces a unique color along with its corresponding hexadecimal color code.

## Features

- Generates a random color with each click or refresh.
- Displays the color's hexadecimal code (e.g., `#A3E4D7`).
- Simple and lightweight code implementation.

## How It Works

The generator uses the following logic:

1. `Math.random()` produces a random number between 0 and 1.
2. This number is scaled and converted into hexadecimal format.
3. The result is a six-character color code prefixed by `#`.
